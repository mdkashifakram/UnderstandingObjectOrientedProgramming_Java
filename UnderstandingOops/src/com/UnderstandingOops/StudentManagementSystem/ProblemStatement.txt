Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a similar question to practice your understanding of class interaction and array management:

Practice Question: School Management System
Question:

Create a Student class with the following attributes:

id (int)
name (String)
grade (double)
Implement the following methods in the Student class:

getId(): Returns the ID of the student.
getName(): Returns the name of the student.
getGrade(): Returns the grade of the student.
Create a Classroom class with the following attributes:

className (String)
students (Student array)
numStudents (int)
Implement the following methods in the Classroom class:

addStudent(Student student): Adds a student to the classroom.
getAverageGrade(): Returns the average grade of all students in the classroom.
getTopStudent(): Returns the Student object with the highest grade in the classroom.

In the main method, use a Scanner object to read the values for the classroom name, 
the number of students, and the student details (id, name, and grade) in a loop. 
Once all student details have been read, create a Classroom object with the appropriate parameters. 
Finally, call the methods to get the average grade and the top student, and print the results.


SAMPLE INPUT:

Enter classroom name: Math 101
Enter number of students: 3
Enter student details:
Student 1:
Enter id: 1
Enter name: Alice
Enter grade: 85.5
Student 2:
Enter id: 2
Enter name: Bob
Enter grade: 92.0
Student 3:
Enter id: 3
Enter name: Charlie
Enter grade: 78.0



SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Average grade: 85.83
Top student: Bob with grade 92.0
